            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, as I guaranteed, I will be actually using the blogging area to post some random things.</p><p>So let's just talk about my current life. I live in a place where you know, exams decide your future school, therefore also decides what your future is.</p><p>I'd say I'm not a very good learner in school subjects considering I always get a B or B+ on most of the tests, which if you want good grades in order to go to a better school you need at least A or A+.</p><p>In Taiwan, most of the junior high school student take the "Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School Students" exam in order to enter your desired school via open admissions (which yes it's called "open admissions" method but students still have to compare exam scores to see which school you're eligible, smh), and the exam is around just 80 days before it starts, so I DON'T KNOW GIVE ME ANSWERS TO THE EXAMS PLEASE.</p><p>Although the teachers will probably say you can enter whatever school you want, but in reality this is still Asian education, obviously your parents want to enter some really high score schools, this is honestly stressful for most of the students including me, if you're seriously expecting a student who doesn't do great at school subjects and make them get good grades right now then you're definitely on crack.</p><p>Whatever bye, I probably will not be too active in Minecraft or Roblox for now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello! This is my Docusaurus website, I always wanted to have one, but I somehow managed to fail compiling the website and each time end up like trash, so I had to get help from <a href="https://gitlab.com/AdminRAT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AdminRAT</a> to help me compile a VuePress website which the archive is still available via <a href="https://raymond-1227.gitlab.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raymond-1227.gitlab.io</a>.</p><p>You might ask why would I replace the VuePress website with Docusaurus? Well, it's simple:</p><ul><li>I don't like its design anymore</li><li>GitLab CI doesn't want to build the latest update</li><li>Too lazy to check what the problem was causing</li></ul><p>It might sound dumb to you, but that's the actual reason why I'm replacing the website.</p><p>So now I'm gonna continue all my work here, the old website will not be deleted and stay in a state of archive.</p>]]></content:encoded>
