            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello! This is my Docusaurus website, I always wanted to have one, but I somehow managed to fail compiling the website and each time end up like trash, so I had to get help from <a href="https://gitlab.com/AdminRAT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AdminRAT</a> to help me compile a VuePress website which the archive is still available via <a href="https://raymond-1227.gitlab.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raymond-1227.gitlab.io</a>.</p><p>You might ask why would I replace the VuePress website with Docusaurus? Well, it's simple:</p><ul><li>I don't like its design anymore</li><li>GitLab CI doesn't want to build the latest update</li><li>Too lazy to check what the problem was causing</li></ul><p>It might sound dumb to you, but that's the actual reason why I'm replacing the website.</p><p>So now I'm gonna continue all my work here, the old website will not be deleted and stay in a state of archive.</p>]]></content:encoded>
