Hello! This is my Docusaurus website, I always wanted to have one, but I somehow managed to fail compiling the website and each time end up like trash, so I had to get help from [@AdminRAT](https://gitlab.com/AdminRAT) to help me compile a VuePress website which the archive is still available via [https://raymond-1227.gitlab.io](https://raymond-1227.gitlab.io).

You might ask why would I replace the VuePress website with Docusaurus? Well, it's simple:
- I don't like its design anymore
- GitLab CI doesn't want to build the latest update
- Too lazy to check what the problem was causing

It might sound dumb to you, but that's the actual reason why I'm replacing the website.

So now I'm gonna continue all my work here, the old website will not be deleted and stay in a state of archive.
