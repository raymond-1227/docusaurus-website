# About Me

## Brief History

In about 2016 or 2017, when I actually started exploring the internet, WebGL games and much other stuff, but at the time I don't code since I've always thought that coding is hard. At the time, I discovered Virtual Machines and how to install them.

In 2018, I learned computer designing. Now I design anything or make "badly designed" photos. (Seriously, trust me that you're gonna hate them)

In 2019, my Discord server had some custom response setup with Dyno bot (a Discord bot FYI) , and someone asked that why it responds with Dyno bot instead of an actual bot response (not like an auto response) , so I coded Googled "how to code a Discord bot", and then I was introduced to coding.
