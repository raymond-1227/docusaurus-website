# About Me

Hello, I'm Raymond. I'm just someone who loves discovering anything in the world, specifically via the world wide web.

## Brief Information

- A he/him
- Lives in Taiwan
- Speaks both English (currently B2) and Chinese fluently (ignore the fact my chinese exam scores are like pretty bad lol)
- Loves to code, design, video edits, and play games

## Brief History

In about 2016 or 2017, when I actually started exploring the internet, WebGL games and much other stuff, but at the time I don't code since I've always thought that coding is hard. At the time, I discovered Virtual Machines and how to install them.

In 2018, I learned about computer graphics designing. Now I design anything or make "badly designed" photos. (Seriously, trust me that you're gonna hate them)

In 2019, my Discord server had some custom response setup with Dyno bot (a Discord bot FYI) , and someone asked that why it responds with Dyno bot instead of an actual bot response (not like an auto response) , so I coded Googled "how to code a Discord bot", and then I was introduced to coding.
