Well, it\'s simple:\\n- I don\'t like its design anymore\\n- GitLab CI doesn\'t want to build the latest update\\n- Too lazy to check what the problem was causing\\n\\nIt might sound dumb to you, but that\'s the actual reason why I\'m replacing the website.\\n\\nSo now I\'m gonna continue all my work here, the old website will not be deleted and stay in a state of archive."}]}')}}]);
