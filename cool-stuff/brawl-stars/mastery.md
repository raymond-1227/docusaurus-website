# Mastery

Mastery Points could only be gained after winning battles or by being the "Star Player". Each Brawler has its own Mastery Point count. An additional 30% Mastery Points are awarded if a player is the "Star Player" of a 3v3 or 5v5 match. Each time a Brawler levels up in Mastery, the player receives Coins, Power Points, Credits, Facepalm Pins, secondary Brawler Profile Icons, or Titles.
