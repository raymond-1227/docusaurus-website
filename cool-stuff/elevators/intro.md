# About

This is a collection of world's fastest elevators and their specifications. Since there is a wide range of buildings that use elevators which operate at a speed of 600 m/min (36 km/hr or 10 m/s), this collection will only include elevators that operate higher than a speed of 600 m/min (36 km/hr or 10 m/s). However, I will list some well-known installations that operate at around the speed of 600 m/min (36 km/hr or 10 m/s) below.
